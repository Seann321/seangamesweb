                Spacey, a game where you build a spaceship out of blocks and that's all it could do. But it was fun to make.

                <img src="images/Bottlecap.png" alt="Bottlecap Spritesheet">
                Bottlecap, a multiplayer RPG. it didn't do much. But it did have a working server and client. Which is pretty much what I made it for.

                <img src="images/MetaSite.png" alt="An early picture of this site">
                This Website while it was still being made, wasn't much there. Hopefully it turned out well.

                <img src="images/Slime.gif" alt="Slime gif">
                I wanted to make a slime game, it took an hour. This is pretty much the whole game.
